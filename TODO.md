# TODO list for completion

## Response

 - [ ] finish the response
 - [ ] line numbering

## Figures

 - [ ] Fig s8 (correlations_fable.pdf) either needs the titles changing to evolutionary rate matrix, not VCV, or removing and A and B adding to the figure and caption


## Table

 - [ ] add the table!

## Text

## Supplementaries

FYI Thomas the supplementaries will need a bit of reordering I think as they should match the order of stuff in the text. Also I think the glossary introduces more confusion than it solves so I'd suggest we cut it as I'm not sure we actually refer to it at any point?

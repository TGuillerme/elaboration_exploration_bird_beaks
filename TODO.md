# TODO list for completion

## Analyses

 - [ ] Passeriformes bit: just rerun the whole thing on passerines with 50 levels (2 sub-orders and 48 patch clades (~ families?)) [TG]
 - [ ] Sensitivity: make a null to see if the main results (the nested structure) and orthogonality is present with no phylo signal. For tha just simulate a Brownian motion trait and a pure birth tree, cut two clades (first split) and run the beer pipeline on that? [TG]
 - [ ] Sensitivity: check the effect of using a phylo PCA or not (just on the Charadriformes for easiness) [TG]

## Manuscript

 - [ ] Check the methods section
 - [ ] Decide on the main narrative (the beer brocolli?)
 - [ ] Finalise the manuscript writing (multiple passes, set an order and deadline for the multiple passes?)
 - [ ] Pepper with references (using google docs or LaTeX?)

## Figures

 - [ ] Finalise figure anus: what info do we want in it?
 - [ ] Finalise correlation figure: alignments and stuff
 - [ ] Finalise ellipses figure: alignnments and stuff
 - [ ] Check figure 0 (helper)

## Supplementaries

 - [ ] Figure 0?
 - [ ] Passerines?
 - [ ] methods vignettes (but see reproducibility)?

## README and reproducibility

 - [ ] check list is already in the README (needing to check english/compiling/links for all of them)
 - [ ] deciding of a realease date for the packages?

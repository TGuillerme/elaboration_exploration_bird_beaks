# TODO list for completion

## TODOs comment from gdocs

 - [ ] ellipses comparison table
 - [ ] edits on fig_ortho (remove passersiformes and spaces)
 - [ ] edits on fig_ortho change transparency to dashes
 - [ ] edits on fig_ortho add the 0.75 line
 - [ ] edit par5 with link to par4
 - [ ] table with the boxplot values results to add to supplementary
 - [ ] make passseriformes all results in supplementary
 - [ ] TODO: add PC1 loading for phylo group


## Analyses

 - [ ] Passeriformes bit: just rerun the whole thing on passerines with 50 levels (2 sub-orders and 48 patch clades (~ families?)) [TG]
 - [ ] Sensitivity for clade effect: make a null to see if the main results (the nested structure) and orthogonality is present with no phylo signal. For tha just simulate a Brownian motion trait and a pure birth tree, cut two clades (first split) and run the beer pipeline on that? [TG]: actually do the simulations on the charadriiformes tree with two simulations: one is randomly assigning the beak shapes to each bird and second is generating brownian motion beask [for the pankackness, transform the pca to be spherical and rerun the analysis on charadriiformes to see if that changes anything.
 - [x] fast piggles
 - [x] check something about random skewers method (basically how many ellipses are expeccted to be the same geometrically) + measure the angle variance for each ellipse
 - [x] make sure what we see is what we see.
 - [x] put all the ellipses together in a figure and compare them scaled aligned. Then compare the position of the ellipses for each cherries in terms of angle, alignment and distance.


## Manuscript

 - [x] clean the google doc [TG]
 - [x] add figures [TG]
 - [x] go through all the manuscript by the end of Friday [GT]
 - [x] Check the methods section [NC AB]
 - [x] Decide on the main narrative (the beer brocolli?) [to be figured out while working on the draft]
 - [ ] Lines of least resistance becomes major axis of phenotypic VCV
 - [ ] Finalise the manuscript writing (multiple passes, set an order and deadline for the multiple passes?)
 - [ ] Pepper with references (using google docs or LaTeX?) [TG to do later]
 - [ ] do a completion checkkist: abstract + acknowledgments + funding grant codes 

## Figures

 - [ ] Finalise figure anus: what info do we want in it? [GT]
 - [x] Finalise correlation figure: alignments and stuff [TG]
 - [x] Finalise ellipses figure: alignnments and stuff [TG]
 - [x] Check figure 0 (helper) [TG]
 - [x] Write a detailed explanation for that figure (cheat sheet)

## Supplementaries

 - [ ] Passerines?
 - [ ] methods vignettes (but see reproducibility)?
 - [x] start adding them at the bottom of the google doc [TG]
      - [ ] missing the math thingy
      - [ ] missing the projection/rejection illustration

## README and reproducibility

 - [ ] check list is already in the README (needing to check english/compiling/links for all of them)
 - [ ] deciding of a release date for the packages?
 - [ ] make sure the data is there and available (tidied and packaged!)
 - [ ] Natalie to check the vignettes

## Poster

 - [ ] Do poster for ESEB [TG]

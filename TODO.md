# TODO list for completion

## TODOs comment from gdocs

 - [x] edits on fig_ortho (remove passersiformes and spaces)
 - [x] edits on fig_ortho change transparency to dashes
 - [x] edits on fig_ortho add the 0.75 line
 - [x] edit par5 with link to par4
 - [x] table with the boxplot values results to add to supplementary
 - [x] make passseriformes all results in supplementary
 - [x] add PC1 loading for phylo group

## Analyses

 - [x] Passeriformes bit: just rerun the whole thing on passerines with 50 levels (2 sub-orders and 48 patch clades (~ families?)) [TG]
 - [x] Sensitivity for clade effect: make a null to see if the main results (the nested structure) and orthogonality is present with no phylo signal. For tha just simulate a Brownian motion trait and a pure birth tree, cut two clades (first split) and run the beer pipeline on that? [TG]: actually do the simulations on the charadriiformes tree with two simulations: one is randomly assigning the beak shapes to each bird and second is generating brownian motion beask [for the pankackness, transform the pca to be spherical and rerun the analysis on charadriiformes to see if that changes anything.
 - [x] fast piggles
 - [x] check something about random skewers method (basically how many ellipses are expeccted to be the same geometrically) + measure the angle variance for each ellipse
 - [x] make sure what we see is what we see.
 - [x] put all the ellipses together in a figure and compare them scaled aligned. Then compare the position of the ellipses for each cherries in terms of angle, alignment and distance.
 - [x] Compare passeriformes ellipses from the whole space model (level 2) to the the ones from the passeriformes space model (level 0) to see the difference there.
 - [x] measure the variance explained in the model for the random terms and the residuals
 - [x] check variance partitioning with just 1D and then check the variance partition. Try running a 100 iterations on brms with the super-order model


## Manuscript

 - [x] clean the google doc [TG]
 - [x] add figures [TG]
 - [x] go through all the manuscript by the end of Friday [GT]
 - [x] Check the methods section [NC AB]
 - [x] Decide on the main narrative (the beer brocolli?) [to be figured out while working on the draft]
 - [x] Lines of least resistance becomes major axis of phenotypic VCV
 - [x] Finalise the manuscript writing (multiple passes, set an order and deadline for the multiple passes?)
 - [x] Pepper with references (using google docs or LaTeX?) [TG to do later]
 - [x] do a completion checkkist: abstract + acknowledgments + funding grant codes 
 - [x] make a glossary 
 - [x] rewrite the narrative start
 - [x] cite (Stebbins 1974, Futuyma et al 1993, Schluter 1996) for LOLR (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.13.507810v1.full) (in general first intro paragraph)
 - [x] cite Masahito
 - [ ] write cover letter
 - [ ] find reviewers


## Figures

 - [x] Finalise figure anus: what info do we want in it? [GT]
 - [x] Finalise correlation figure: alignments and stuff [TG]
 - [x] Finalise ellipses figure: alignnments and stuff [TG]
 - [x] Check figure 0 (helper) [TG]
 - [x] Write a detailed explanation for that figure (cheat sheet)
 - [x] Figure 4: change "group" to "clade"
 - [x] Figure 4: remove the bottom row (and just write down the test results in the figure)
 - [x] Update figure orthogonality (missing a couple of orders)
 - [x] ggplotise figure 4 (plus integrate comments from overleaf):
          natalie.cooper: this figure needs the headers removing and slightly large axes labels. Looks a bit scrappy compared to the rest of the figures at the moment
          natalie.cooper: Also get rid of the bhattacharya bit on the plots, just put into the legend
          gavin.thomas: Yeah, I agree. I hate to say it but it looks like it needs a ggplot overhaul, or at least filling the areas under the curves along with the smartening up that Natalie suggests.
 - [x] Figure anus: change "novelty" to elaboration/innovation in the right boxplot and remove it from the left one.
 - [x] fig orthogonality, remove box + add hyphen to superorder

## Supplementaries

 - [x] supp tables from the main text
 - [x] supp math from the main text
 - [x] supp passerines results
 - [x] supp big ellipse table containing n, sd, orthogonality, elaboration/innovation.
 - [x] Passerines?
 - [x] methods vignettes (but see reproducibility)?
 - [x] start adding them at the bottom of the google doc [TG]
      - [x] missing the math thingy
      - [x] missing the projection/rejection illustration
 - [x] check through all the supplementaries
 - [x] update cheat sheet figure

## README and reproducibility

 - [x] check list is already in the README (needing to check english/compiling/links for all of them)
 - [x] deciding of a release date for the packages?
 - [x] make sure the data is there and available (tidied and packaged!)
 - [x] Natalie to check the vignettes
 - [x] check the vignettes and re-upload the data

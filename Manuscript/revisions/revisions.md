OK, I've gone through the comments in details and it's actually pretty good! The main points are

1. More words throughout (references and explanation)
2. Re-integrate the correlation figure
3. Mathematically link innov/elab to other metrics

Shapespace comment: don't do it.


TODO: reading
 - [ ] Houle 2017
 - [ ] Wannatabe 2021

 - [ ] Redo figure spirograph in bird island style.
    - [x] Centred on the orders (for orders, also add the ellipse for the super order).
    - [ ] Colour the ellipses in a orange blue gradient scaling with the amount of elaboration and innovation. 
    - [ ] Make the ellipses the same size
 - [ ] Redo the cheat sheet figure with the macro and mega definitions
 - [x] pgls bit on a tree subsample
 - [ ] link orthogonality to random skewers
 - [ ] link E/I to relative eigenvector dispersion (Pavlicev et al., 2009, Watanabe, 2022) 
 - [ ] link E/I to conditional evolvability (Hansen & Houle, 2008) 
 - [ ] link E/I to integration (Hansen & Houle, 2008)

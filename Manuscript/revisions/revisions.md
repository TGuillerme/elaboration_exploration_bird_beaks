OK, I've gone through the comments in details and it's actually pretty good! The main points are

1. More words throughout (references and explanation)
2. Re-integrate the correlation figure
3. Mathematically link innov/elab to other metrics
<!-- 4. * Look at innov/elab through time -->
<!-- 5. * Calculate rates of innov/elab? -->
<!-- 6. * Link innov/elab in figure 4 using the same VCVs -->
<!-- 7. * redo the PGLS centroid_distance ~ innovation + elaboration -->


The points with * will need us to rerun some calculations but only based on the VCVs, basically we don't need to rerun the mcmcmcmcmcmgllmmmmmm!

Do a cartoon for defining meso/micro/mega/macro in a tree.

Split figure 2. Make the e/i barplots wider

Shapespace comment: don't do it.

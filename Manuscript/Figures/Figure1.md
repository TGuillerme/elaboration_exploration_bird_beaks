Figure 1: Elaboration and innovation per super orders and orders.

When measuring the global elaboration and innovation along the phylogenetic's "line of least resistance" we see a great variation of strategies for clades to diversify at different levels.
Here we represent the group's average posterior variance-covariance matrix (the colored ellipses) scaled to be the same size as the phylogenetic's average posterior variance-covariance matrix (the grey ellipses).
Note that these are 2D representations of 8D ellipsoids hence the variation in size of their projections.
We can see the great diversity in group's "evolutionary strategies" corresponding to the diversity of ellipses orientation and position (the ellipses are centered on the group's centroid).
Some groups like Teluraves are relatively low innovators and elaborators, others, like the  Podicipediformes are relatively high elaborators and innovators.
However some groups also display contrasting levels of elaboration and innovations like the Strigiformes (relatively low and high respectively) and the Coraciiformes (relatively high and low respectively).

We also see a great variation of the elaboration and innovation for each individual species relative to the phylogenetic line of least resistance.
Here we represent the elaboration and innovation scores for each species and their position in the trait space (distance from the centre of the space).
We see a great interspecific variation contrasting with the global variation between groups (see Figure 1).
For example [... Gonna have a look at the figure to find some flamingoes in there ...].

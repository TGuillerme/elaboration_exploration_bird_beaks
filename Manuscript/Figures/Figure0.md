Figure 0: concept of elaboration and exploration.
Given a traitspace where the dimensions are some traits (or transformation thereof) and species are points in this space (in orange), we can calculate the variance-covariance matrix of these traits.
This variance-covariance matrix can be represented as a 95% confidence interval ellipse (the grey ellipse) or the major axis of that ellipse (the grey axis).
This axis can be interpreted as the axis of variance-covariance or, if the variance-covariance matrix is calculated taking the phylogenetic relation between species into account, it can be interpreted as the phylogenetic axis of least resistance.
We can then interpret species' position on this axis as a combination of elaborating species (i.e. species' colinearity with the phylogenetic axis) or innovating species (i.e. their orthogonality with the phylogenetic axis).
The species position in the traitspace can then be interpreted as varying degrees of elaboration and or innovation.

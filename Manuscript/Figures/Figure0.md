Figure 0: concept of elaboration and exploration.

One common way for species shapes' to diversity is along some "line of least resistance" or, in more general terms, a major axis of variance and covariance between traits.
A majority of biodiversity can thus arise from the elaboration of shapes and traits combination at different taxonomic levels.
For example, the taxonomic units here elaborate on the elongation axis that is the major variance-covariance axis between two traits.
An alternative way for biodiversity to arise, however, is when species shapes evolve orthogonally to the "line of least resistance".
In that case, the biodiversity arises from the innovation of shapes and traits combination.
For example, some taxonomic units can change drastically in shape without any amount of elaboration along the major axis of variance-covariance.
In general we can describe the amount of elaboration and innovation of a group (e.g. super order, order) or a species and use that to describe and understand the differences in diversification between groups and species.

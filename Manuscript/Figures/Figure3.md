Figure 3: Elaboration and exploration distribution per species within each superorder.

We analysed the correlation and distribution of innovation and elaboration scores in two ways (panel A), first by projecting species onto the main phylogenetic axis (panel B and C) to measure the absolute distribution of elaboration and innovation among all species (B) and in each super-order (C - coloured by order, see below).
We found no obvious correlation between exploration and elaboration (B) but major differences in patterns between super orders (C) with some having nearly all combinations of elaboration and innovation (like Aequornithes) and some others presenting lower amounts of innovation but higher amounts of elaboration (e.g. Otidimorphae) and others presenting low elaboration and high innovation (e.g. Palaeognathes).
Second, we projected the species onto their own phylogenetic axis (panel D) to measure their relative elaboration and innovation.
Here again, we found an array of diversification patterns with somewhat more correlation between both elaboration and innovation (especially in Mirandornithes). We can interpret the difference between the two patterns (C and D) as potentially different ways to diversify within a group.
In the case of Mirandornithes for example, most diversity arise from some varying degrees of elaboration on the general phylogenetic "line of least resistance" (in Podicipediformes) whereas some other groups (flamingos, here classified as others) achieve high innovation without much elaboration on the general phylogenetic line of least resistance.
However when looking at the patterns of elaboration/innovation within the group (panel D), we can see that each species elaborate and innovate in the same continuous manner.
In other words, although flamingoes beaks are special among all birds (high innovation without high elaboration), they are not as special among their superorder (albeit they still have extreme morphologies).

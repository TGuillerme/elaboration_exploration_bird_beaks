TODO figures:
- [x] Thomas: send the median values for species (elaboration, exploration, dist to centre) to all
- [x] Thomas: make figure 1, figure 3 a,b,c
Try to make the ellipses scaled (so they don't give an idea of trait space size)
Transform the box plots in line plots 
Gavin: make figure 2
- [x] Thomas: make figure 0 (conceptual one - see images from the grant)
-Put the things directly on the line (like exagerated) for the elaboration
For the exploration put them completely orthogonal and make them triangles
Do just the cigar figure: three panels, normal, sliding and twisting
- [x] Thomas: do one paragraph version per parts of method (check Chrisâ€™ nature paper)


Figure 3: insist on the differences in panel A. not just describe, say what it means

TODO writing
 - [x] Thomas: do one paragraph version per parts of method (check Chrisâ€™ nature paper)
 - [x] Write figure 0 abstract/caption
 - [x] Write figure 1 abstract/caption
 - [x] Write figure 2 abstract/caption
 - [x] Write figure 3 abstract/caption
 - [x] Write the paper abstract https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJ0q7lqUsAAaEFC.png:large
 - [x] Start doing a 1st and last paragraph for the 7 paragraphs
 - [ ] Write the flipping thing!

TODO supplementaries:
 - [x] Thomas: supplementary figures and tables
 - [ ] Thomas: data vignette
 - [x] Thomas: mcmcmcglmmm vignette -> now in the mcmcmcglmmm package
 - [x] Thomas: projection vignette (with all the math bits) -> now in the dispRity package
 - [ ] Thomas: clean the figure markdowns
 - [ ] Thomas: measure the ellipses difference: difference = sum(abs(major_axis_phylo - major_axis_group))

TODO figures:
 - [x] Figure 2: calculate pagel's lambda for 1) the whole tree 2) per super order and 3) per order for innovation and elaboration (and squeeze these results in figure 1 as Order_name\nE_lambda =, I_lambda =...)
 - [x] Figure 0: try with transparency of ellipses
 - [x] Figure 1: add A abd B for order/super: change elaboration to just E and innovation to just have them as a letter above the boxplot (line)
 - [ ] Think about making some kind of shiny app (not me) on a dynamic variation of figure 0 (with VCV tools).
 - [x] Set up the analysis to run just for passeriformes. Use patchclades and suborders as nested levels.
 - [ ] Figure 2: needs to be done

TODO analyses:
 - [ ] Calculate the lambdas for the elaboration and exploration per group and for the whole tree

TODO meeting:
 - [ ] Discuss the narrative I ended up stuck with (see paper draft)
 - [ ] Maybe think twice about those ellipses: we have been easily mixing them up with an idea of volume where they are in fact an idea of variance-covariance (in our case). Maybe that's something important to keep in mind?
 - [ ] Do we add passeriformes to it? Results are pending (probably 2 weeks more for stable results/next week for exploitable results): this will add an extra panel to the figures 1 and 3.

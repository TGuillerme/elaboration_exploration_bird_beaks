- How do clades fill the beak shapespace (how do they diversify in that space): you either elaborate, either explore, or both.
    This fits with Simpson's least resistance idea
- Here we can sort of classify radiations: we give an """objective""" way to quantify diversification events.

- Get a figure with the idea of a shape slightly changing on an allometric line (like squares or rectangles) and drastically changing on an exploration line.






TODO: check the exploration score (needs to be unit as the semi major axis)




Do the big plot at the super order level of exploration vs. elaboration with density 

For Natalie, give:
1- list of median exploration values per species
2- list of median ellaboration values per species
3- list of distances to centre per species



TODO figures:
- [x] Thomas: send the median values for species (elaboration, exploration, dist to centre) to all
- [ ] Thomas: make figure 1, figure 3 a,b,c
Gavin: make figure 2
- [ ] Thomas: make figure 0 (conceptual one - see images from the grant)
- [ ] Thomas: do one paragraph version per parts of method (check Chrisâ€™ nature paper)

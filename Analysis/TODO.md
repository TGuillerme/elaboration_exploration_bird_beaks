TODO figures:
- [x] Thomas: send the median values for species (elaboration, exploration, dist to centre) to all
- [x] Thomas: make figure 1, figure 3 a,b,c
Try to make the ellipses scaled (so they don't give an idea of trait space size)
Transform the box plots in line plots 
Gavin: make figure 2
- [x] Thomas: make figure 0 (conceptual one - see images from the grant)
-Put the things directly on the line (like exagerated) for the elaboration
For the exploration put them completely orthogonal and make them triangles
Do just the cigar figure: three panels, normal, sliding and twisting
- [x] Thomas: do one paragraph version per parts of method (check Chrisâ€™ nature paper)


Figure 3: insist on the differences in panel A. not just describe, say what it means


GEt the story told through the figure legends as mini abstracts



- [x] scale the ellipses to be the same sizes in figure 1
- [x] Write figure 0 abstract/caption
- [x] Write figure 1 abstract/caption
- [x] Write figure 2 abstract/caption
- [x] Write figure 3 abstract/caption
- [x] Write the paper abstract https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJ0q7lqUsAAaEFC.png:large


TODO supplementaries:
 - [x] Thomas: supplementary figures and tables
 - [ ] Thomas: data vignette
 - [ ] Thomas: mcmcmcglmmm vignette -> now in the mcmcmcglmmm package
 - [ ] Thomas: projection vignette (with all the math bits) -> now in the dispRity package
 - [ ] Thomas: clean the figure markdowns


 - Figure 2: calculate pagel's lambda for 1) the whole tree 2) per super order and 3) per order for innovation and elaboration (and squeeze these results in figure 1 as Order_name\nE_lambda =, I_lambda =...)
  - [ ] Thomas: 
 - Figure 0: try with transparency of ellipses
  - [ ] Thomas: 
 - Figure 1: add A abd B for order/super
            change elaboration to just E and innovation to just have them as a letter above the boxplot (line)
    - [ ] Thomas: 
 - Start doing a 1st and last paragraph for the 7 paragraphs
  - [ ] Thomas: 
 - Think about making some kind of shiny app (not me) on a dynamic variation of figure 0 (with VCV tools).
  - [ ] Thomas: 
 - Set up the analysis to run just for passeriformes. Use patchclades and suborders as nested levels.
  - [ ] Thomas:

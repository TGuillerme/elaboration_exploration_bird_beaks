# Agenda:

 - Review the protocol:
     - Data
     - mcmcmcglmmm. TODO: discuss convergence
     - projections
 
 - Show some results

 - Discuss a question forward
     - Distribution of exploration differential: for any cherry, does one species explore more than the other?
     - Distribution of negative elaboration: which species elaborate in the other way?
     - Distribution of exploration/elaboration: is it random or clustered?
     - From Natalie's public engagement: "idea of close relatives that donâ€™t look very similar" (which species elaborate/explore more within their own groups?)
     - "Special among flamigoes": which species are "truly" special (explore/elaborate in a nested way) and which ones are "truly" not?
     - Which birds fall out of the 95% for rejection and projections? And within these which ones are overlapping (95% out of the rejection + 95% out of the projections): the truly special ones.

TODO technicals (Thomas):
- check the prep.data function to see if it's sorting things correctly!
    - Done. It was fucked up.
- do 2D slice representations of all ellipses/axes
    - Done. (but not displayed)
- plot the difference to the phylo + the differences within per group

- elaboration scores: just show the absolute values
    - Done.
- color all the scatter plots by the next level down ()

- Do methods in Thomas english

- Check if the coloured ellipses are corresponding to the right level (clade)

- Calculate the average ellipse/axis on the average VCV rather than on all the ellipses/axis

- Add an option to calculate the ellipse/axis directly from the VCV eigen values (no 95%)

- Find the highest elaborator/innovator overall (for the species vs. group, do an absolute and a scaled version)

- Check the blind spots in the ela/ino corelation plots (add a species in a weird place of the morphospace)

- On the correlation plots add a phylo panel with the clades coloured

- Re-do the box plots: order them by scores and remove the angle bit
